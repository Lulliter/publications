  abstract = {In Brazilian urban favelas, the development of informal connections is common, relatively easy to obtain, and allow citizens to acquire electricity eluding or reducing the regular charging of consumption. Genuine affordability problems and limited means of subsistence are the most important but not exhaustive explanation of theft and nonpayment problems afflicting energy distribution companies. With a preliminary evaluation of the project ``Conviver: energia para viver melhor'', implemented in Belo Horizonte, this thesis studies the determinants of illegal connections and energy fraud in the context of low-income urban favelas. Using the tecnique of logistic regression, the study illustrates how the probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained by the following concurring factors: inadequate energy provision and lacking equipment; income and affordability; inefficient and incorrect use of domestic electric appliances. Additionally, based on the Conviver sample of 15,279 households, the thesis provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of different pro-poor schemes (government poverty subsidies and electricity block tariffs) at subsidizing energy costs for poor customers. The analysis proves that social tariffs, even though not exclusively responsible, can be considered as factors that mitigate the occurrence of illegality. The type of social tariffs that work better are the ones that are more strictly connected to consumption, as opposed to those linked to poverty subsidies. This make a strong case for a ``tariff engineering'' that takes into serious account the electricity needs in term of consumption, and try to segment the customers to realistically match the actual needs (minimum; low-medium; houses with micro-businesses in the dwelling). As the preliminary outcomes of the Conviver program document, the positive effect of propoor tariff schemes will be even multiplied if combined with effort for the orientation of low-income customers to energy-saving behaviors.},

In Europe there are around three hundred major international RIs and perhaps one thousand significant ones including those mostly funded by national governments, often with some support from the EU. The workshop will foster the dialogue between scientists, economists, managers, and policy experts about new approaches of the production of knowledge.

  abstract = {It is puzzling how a priority as vital as the optimal maintenance of infrastructure gets so little attention in the public policy debate and in the national strategic infrastructure investment plans. In the case of Italy, an information deficit, inadequate strategic planning and governance, and unpreparedness for macro changes affecting infrastructure services emerge as critical root causes of such neglect. Arguably, some responsibility lies with the EU policies as well: fiscal austerity after the great financial crisis, followed by a hasty shift towards the European Green Deal approach to infrastructure may have brought the unintended consequence of under-investment in the care for existing assets. Although certain challenges remain unmet, several case studies show the country's commitment to address some of the issues. Notably, the creation of an integrated repository tracking all the country's infrastructure projects, or the national guidelines recently issued to rank and prioritize bridge safety interventions. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363851925\_Italy\_in\_front\_of\_the\_challenge\_of\_infrastructure\_maintenance\_existing\_issues\_and\_promising\_responses\_Challenges\_of\_infrastructure\_maintenance},

  abstract = {This report originated as a contribution to the ``Program of Integrated Public Policies for the Youth,'' through which the IDB is supporting the Brazilian Municipality of Fortaleza in fostering socio-economic inclusion for young people in disadvantaged contexts.  The first contribution of the study is to offer a synthetic outline of the issues and challenges relative to social and productive exclusion of young people, distinguishing between developed and developing regions, with special attention to Brazil. The report identifies and outlines, with empirical evidence, the following five macro-challenges that youth employment currently poses to countries like Brazil. Namely: (a) insufficient educational attainment and quality; (b) poverty, vulnerability, and youth at risk; (c) mismatch in labor supply and demand; (d) lack of opportunities and high incidence of informality; and (e) expected labor market effects of the ongoing crisis. Against such a framework, the study identifies and describes eight worldwide best practices in the field of youth employment policies. The choice of the case studies maintains an explicit focus on programs with an emphasis on the promotion of self-employment and entrepreneurship as alternative tools to tap an existing under-exploited young entrepreneurial potential, in a context of shrinking labor demand from the public and formal sector.  The identified most successful and sustainable programs (retrieved in a variety of different contexts) consistently show some common key success factors. In particular, they exhibit an emphasis on selection and targeting (according to age, education level, and access to credit, business networks, and tools); a ``person-centered'' approach (as opposed to ``product-'' or ``policy-centered''); and a proper combination of business-related and training initiatives. A documented barrier is often the lack of coordination between public agencies, at different levels, with the private sector and local civil society representatives. Additionally, in the Brazilian context, it seems utterly important to balance efforts between measures that increase the labor welfare for all, while simultaneously striving to improve the business environment and incentivize microenterprises to register.},

  abstract = {Following the COVID-19 shock to economies and societies, many countries are renewing infrastructure investment as a stimulus measure. Such investments present an opportunity for governments to address short-term infrastructure challenges through maintenance spending while building resilient and sustainable infrastructure for the future. Infrastructure resilience and maintenance requires a multidimensional approach, considering a range of factors and stakeholders at the local, regional, national and global levels to identify trade-offs among objectives and enable more robust policy choices. Drawing on examples and case studies, this report provides a framework for optimising existing infrastructure assets and building new resilient infrastructure. It also includes strategies for ensuring quality and performance over an asset's lifecycle.},

  abstract = {Given the broad array of issues and  the complexity faced by the water sector as a whole (from  irrigation to flood protection, to water conservation and  hydropower), there is great demand for future exploring the  potential of RBF and tackling the questions still unanswered  about many of its operational dimensions. This document  takes a closer look at some of the practical aspects of  implementing various RBF water schemes. Chapter 2 provides  an analytical framework to explore if and when RBF can be a  viable option, shedding light on some key factors and  preconditions that are necessary for RBF to work--with the  understanding that it can be used either as an alternative  or a complement to a more traditional input-based funding  scheme. Chapter 3 then revisits the concepts discussed in  the analytical framework through the analysis of various  case studies of RBF approaches in different water-related  areas. Some of the case studies are based on actual projects  already implemented or ongoing, while others are an  illustrative elaboration, given the lack of practical cases  to use as sources. Chapter 4 presents some conclusions and  lessons learned. The key challenges that are likely to be  encountered in designing an RBF scheme deal with: the  clarity and level of certainty of the relationships from  input to output to outcomes (causal links); the ease and  availability of measurable indicators; and, consequently,  the optimal determination of the necessary incentive(s) to  align the goals of the principal with the agents'  deliverables. Appendix A presents a glossary of RBF concepts  and acronyms. Appendix B presents specific results and  indicators which may be relevant for different sectors.},

Resilient infrastructure depends on the regular maintenance of assets, especially in the face of climate change. More spending alone is not the answer as new approaches to the planning, costing, and delivery of maintenance, operations are needed. Lessons from private sector engagement are shared.},
