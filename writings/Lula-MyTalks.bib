To ensure quality of services, infrastructure needs to be resilient. The G20 report on resilience and maintenance of infrastructure - Building Resilience , developed by the OECD, presents a framework for optimising existing assets and for building new resilient infrastructure in order to ensure infrastructure quality and performance over the asset lifecycle. The framework leverages new technologies and nature based solutions for infrastructure. This report also supported along a World Bank report,  the development of the G20 Policy Agenda on Infrastructure Maintenance presented by the Italian presidency at the G20 Ministries of Finance and Central Banks meeting in July 2021. {$\bullet$}	Ms. Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of England's Environment Agency and CCRI Co-Chair (TBC) 	CBRI/Resilient Coalition (TBD) {$\bullet$}	Mr. Luisa Mimmi, Senior Advisor at the G7/G20 Coordination Unit, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Italy (TBC) {$\bullet$}	Mr. Herman Jan Wijnants, Coordinator Energy and Climate Change, Dutch Ministry for Infrastructure and Water (TBC) Moderator:  {$\bullet$}	Ms. Lisa Mitchell, Senior Director, Investment, Infrastructure Canada},

The objective of the 2020 workshop is to advance the debate on the socio-economic impact of large-scale science projects. In particular the workshop will focus on the new Research Infrastructure (RI) paradigm of science production: bottom up approach; international coalitions of funders, accessibility by multiple users; open science approach; outreach and involvement of citizens. In Europe there are around three hundred major international RIs and perhaps one thousand significant ones including those mostly funded by national governments, often with some support from the EU. The workshop will foster the dialogue between scientists, economists, managers, and policy experts about new approaches of the production of knowledge. There will also be a discussion about what we are learning from the pandemic.},
